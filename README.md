# TextGeneticAlgorithm
A Simple Genetic Algorithm, implemented in C#, exemplifying the abilities of Genetic Algorithms.

## Overview
### 1. Genetic Algorithms
Biological evolution has proven itself to be able to accomplish the seemingly impossible. For the problem of genetic survival, not only are there
innumerable "solutions", but infinitely-many subtle variables impacting the viability of said solutions. 

When a biological "solution", provided by life's genetic code, proved itself to be sub-optimal or subversive, evolution whittled away 
at their continued reproduction, slowly removing "bad solutions" from the gene pool. Conversely, when a biological "solution" proved 
itself in someway beneficial, evolution rewarded it by increasing its reproduction, slowly increasing the availability of these 
"good solutions" to the problem of genetic survival.

By applying the successful principles developed by millions upon millions of years of evolution to real-world problems through software,
we can find efficient solutions to complex problems quickly and effectively.
